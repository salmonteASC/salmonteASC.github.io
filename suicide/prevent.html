        <h5><b>Ask For Help</b></h5>
      <p>Teenage suicide can be prevented/lowered in a few ways. These ways are asking for help, lowering the amount of ignorance,
           and psychotherapy. Asking for help is a great way to prevent suicide. This is because people can help you overcome 
           the problems you are dealing with. Suicide might seem like the easiest solutions to family and personal problems, 
           but these problems can be overcome with the help of others. People who feel like committing suicide shouldnâ€™t 
           be afraid to ask for help<a href = "https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org">(National Suicide Prevention Lifeline)</a>. This can help people erase the thoughts of 
           committing suicide.</p>

    <h5><b>Raise Awareness</b></h5>
      <p>Lowering the amount of ignorance also helps with preventing/lowering teenage suicide rates. 
          People can be less ignorant by being educated on suicide. Parents should also be aware of any family history 
          of mental illness and they should talk to their children about it. Also if a teenager makes a threat about 
          wanting to harm themselves, it should be taken seriously. This helps lower the amount of 
          ignorance and in return, it lowers the rate of teenage suicide.
