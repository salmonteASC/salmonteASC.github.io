        <h5><b>Ignorance</b></h5>
      <p>leads to suicide because people are unaware of the problems someone else might be going through. 
         In a study conducted to see how the suicide of Dalton, a high school boy, impacted or affected those around him, 
         the findings showed the school personnel’s lack of awareness and knowledge about suicide, 
         and how the nature and structure of schooling make problems for adolescents.
        This shows that because of the lack of awareness about suicide, the school wasn’t able to prevent this suicide. </p>

    <h5><b>Social Media</b></h5>
      <p>When someone commits suicide and it is put up in the media, the media is focused on selling the story. 
          When a teenager sees this, they see the attention given to the story and so they might feel inclined to imitate 
          the behaviors and actions so that they can receive the same attention. Teenagers also feel more inclined because 
          they share similar stresses, problems, and concerns. Many teenagers want attention because they 
          want to feel as though they are loved.
